Point plots with subgroups
Let's continue exploring the dataset of students in secondary school. This time, we'll ask the question: is being in a romantic relationship associated with higher or lower school attendance? And does this association differ by which school the students attend? Let's find out using a point plot.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions 1/3
35 XP
Use sns.catplot() and the student_data DataFrame to create a point plot with relationship status ("romantic") on the x-axis and number of absences ("absences") on the y-axis. Color the points based on the school that they attend ("school").

Instructions 2/3
35 XP
Turn off the confidence intervals for the plot.

Instructions 3/3
30 XP
Since there may be outliers of students with many absences, use the median function that we've imported from numpy to display the median number of absences instead of the average.

# Create a point plot that uses color to create subgroups
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
			data=student_data,
            kind="point",
            hue="school")



# Show plot
plt.show()

# Turn off the confidence intervals for this plot
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
			data=student_data,
            kind="point",
            hue="school",
            ci=None)


# Show plot
plt.show()

 # Import median function from numpy
from numpy import median

# Plot the median number of absences instead of the mean
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
			data=student_data,
            kind="point",
            hue="school",
            ci=None,
            estimator=median)

# Show plot
plt.show()
