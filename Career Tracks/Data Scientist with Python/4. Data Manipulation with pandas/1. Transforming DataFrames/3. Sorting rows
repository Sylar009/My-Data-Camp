Sorting rows
Finding interesting bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.

Sort on …	Syntax
one column	df.sort_values("breed")
multiple columns	df.sort_values(["breed", "weight_kg"])
By combining .sort_values() with .head(), you can answer questions in the form, "What are the top cases where…?".
