Loop over list of lists
Remember the house variable from the Intro to Python course? Have a look at its definition in the script. It's basically a list of lists, where each sublist contains the name and area of a room in your house.

It's up to you to build a for loop from scratch this time!

Write a for loop that goes through each sublist of house and prints out the x is y sqm, where x is the name of the room and y is the area of the room.

Answer:============================================================================================================================

# house list of lists
house = [["hallway", 11.25], 
         ["kitchen", 18.0], 
         ["living room", 20.0], 
         ["bedroom", 10.75], 
         ["bathroom", 9.50]]
         
# Build a for loop from scratch
for area in house:
    print("the " + area[0] + " is " + str(area[1]) + " sqm" )
 
Output:============================================================================================================================

the hallway is 11.25 sqm
    the kitchen is 18.0 sqm
    the living room is 20.0 sqm
    the bedroom is 10.75 sqm
    the bathroom is 9.5 sqm
