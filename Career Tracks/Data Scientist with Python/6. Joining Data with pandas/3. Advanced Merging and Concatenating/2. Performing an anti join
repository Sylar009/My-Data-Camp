Performing an anti join
In our music streaming company dataset, each customer is assigned an employee representative to assist them. In this exercise, filter the employee table 
by a table of top customers, returning only those employees who are not assigned to a customer. The results should resemble the results of an anti join.
The company's leadership will assign these employees additional training so that they can work with high valued customers.

empl_cust = employees.merge(top_cust, on='srid', 
                                 how='left', indicator=True)

# Select the srid column where _merge is left_only
