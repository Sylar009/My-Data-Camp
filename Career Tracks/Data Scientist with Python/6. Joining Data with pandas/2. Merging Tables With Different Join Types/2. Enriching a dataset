Enriching a dataset
Setting how='left' with the .merge()method is a useful technique for enriching or enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table. 
In this exercise, you will start off with a sample of movie data from the movie series Toy Story. Your goal is to enrich this data by adding the marketing 
tag line for each movie. You will compare the results of a left join versus an inner join.

The toy_story DataFrame contains the Toy Story movies. The toy_story and taglines DataFrames have been loaded for you.

print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
