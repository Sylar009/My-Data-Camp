# Turning this all into a DataFrame
You've zipped lists together, created a function to house your code, and even used the function in a list comprehension to generate a list of dictionaries. That was a lot of work and you did a great job!

You will now use all of these to convert the list of dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame. You will see how convenient it is to generate a DataFrame from dictionaries with the DataFrame() function from the pandas package.

The lists2dict() function, feature_names list, and row_lists list have been preloaded for this exercise.

Go for it!

## Instructions

* To use the DataFrame() function you need, first import the pandas package with the alias pd.
* Create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries in list_of_dicts by calling pd.DataFrame(). Assign the resulting DataFrame to df.
* Inspect the contents of df printing the head of the DataFrame. Head of the DataFrame df can be accessed by calling df.head().

#================================================================

``` python
# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Turn list of dicts into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(list_of_dicts)

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())


```
