Lightweight baseball players
To subset both regular Python lists and numpy arrays, you can use square brackets:

x = [4 , 9 , 6, 3, 1]
x[1]
import numpy as np
y = np.array(x)
y[1]
For numpy specifically, you can also use boolean numpy arrays:

high = y > 5
y[high]
The code that calculates the BMI of all baseball players is already included. Follow the instructions and reveal interesting things 
from the data!

Instructions

Create a boolean numpy array: the element of the array should be True if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the 
< operator for this. Name the array light.
Print the array light.
Print out a numpy array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use light inside square brackets to do a selection on 
the bmi array.

Answer:============================================================================================================================

# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight with correct units: np_weight_kg
np_weight = np.array(weight_lb)
np_weight_kg = np_weight * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m**2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)

 
Output:============================================================================================================================
