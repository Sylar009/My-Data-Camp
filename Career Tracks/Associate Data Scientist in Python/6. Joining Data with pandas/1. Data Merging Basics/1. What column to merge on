What column to merge on?
Chicago provides a list of taxicab owners and vehicles licensed to operate within the city, for public safety. Your goal is to merge two tables together. One table is called taxi_owners, with info about the taxi cab company owners, and one is called taxi_veh, with info about each taxi cab vehicle. Both the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables have been loaded for you and you can explore them in the IPython shell.

Choose the column you would use to merge the two tables on using the .merge() method.
