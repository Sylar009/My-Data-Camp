Driving right (1)
Remember that cars dataset, containing the cars per 1000 people (cars_per_cap) and whether people drive right (drives_right) for different countries (country)? The code that imports this data in CSV format into Python as a DataFrame is included in the script.

In the video, you saw a step-by-step approach to filter observations from a DataFrame based on boolean arrays. Let's start simple and try to find all observations in cars where drives_right is True.

drives_right is a boolean column, so you'll have to extract it as a Series and then use this boolean Series to select observations from cars.

Answer:============================================================================================================================

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars.loc[:,'drives_right']

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)

 
Output:============================================================================================================================

cars_per_cap        country  drives_right
    US            809  United States          True
    RU            200         Russia          True
    MOR            70        Morocco          True
    EG             45          Egypt          True
