Driving right (2)
The code in the previous example worked fine, but you actually unnecessarily created a new variable dr. You can achieve the same result without this intermediate variable. Put the code that computes dr straight into the square brackets that select observations from cars.

Convert the code to a one-liner that calculates the variable sel as before.

Answer:============================================================================================================================

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
 
sel = cars[cars['drives_right']]

# Print sel
print(sel)
 
Output:============================================================================================================================

cars_per_cap        country  drives_right
    US            809  United States          True
    RU            200         Russia          True
    MOR            70        Morocco          True
