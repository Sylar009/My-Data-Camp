# The CLT in action
The central limit theorem states that a sampling distribution of a sample statistic approaches the normal distribution as you take more samples, no matter the original distribution being sampled from.

In this exercise, you'll focus on the sample mean and see the central limit theorem in action while examining the num_users column of amir_deals more closely, which contains the number of people who intend to use the product Amir is selling.

pandas as pd, numpy as np, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt are loaded and amir_deals is available.

### Instructions 1/4

* Create a histogram of the num_users column of amir_deals and show the plot.

``` python
# Create a histogram of num_users and show
amir_deals['num_users'].hist()
plt.show()

```

### Instructions 2/4

* Set the seed to 104.
* Take a sample of size 20 with replacement from the num_users column of amir_deals, and take the mean.

``` python
# Set seed to 104
np.random.seed(104)

# Sample 20 num_users with replacement from amir_deals
samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)

# Take mean of samp_20
print(np.mean(samp_20))

```

``` output
output:
    32.0

```

### Instructions 3/4

* Repeat this 100 times using a for loop and store as sample_means. This will take 100 different samples and calculate the mean of each.

``` python
# Set seed to 104
np.random.seed(104)

# Sample 20 num_users with replacement from amir_deals and take mean
samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
np.mean(samp_20)

sample_means = []
# Loop 100 times
for i in range(100):
  # Take sample of 20 num_users
  samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
  # Calculate mean of samp_20
  samp_20_mean = np.mean(samp_20)
  # Append samp_20_mean to sample_means
  sample_means.append(samp_20_mean)
  
print(sample_means)

```

``` output
output:
    [31.35, 45.05, 33.55, 38.15, 50.85, 31.85, 34.65, 36.25, 38.9, 44.05, 35.45, 37.6, 37.95, 28.85, 33.3, 31.65, 45.5, 43.2, 24.4, 41.05, 37.2, 39.3, 29.45, 33.55, 45.3, 45.1, 30.95, 36.25, 37.65, 42.55, 34.55, 41.1, 36.9, 42.45, 38.45, 45.9, 42.7, 38.4, 32.55, 30.25, 38.0, 38.75, 49.3, 39.55, 49.05, 42.05, 41.0, 40.6, 58.25, 34.55, 51.2, 34.15, 36.95, 42.45, 41.85, 33.2, 36.15, 37.55, 34.2, 29.75, 42.35, 43.75, 29.0, 32.05, 31.65, 44.6, 30.85, 29.6, 37.7, 33.1, 36.35, 40.65, 45.7, 33.8, 40.1, 39.9, 33.5, 32.65, 32.85, 42.85, 35.4, 31.7, 32.0, 33.85, 36.6, 44.35, 39.9, 37.0, 37.3, 42.5, 38.35, 42.8, 44.55, 30.3, 50.45, 42.35, 40.65, 29.85, 39.3, 33.1]

```

### Instructions 4/4

* Convert sample_means into a pd.Series, create a histogram of the sample_means, and show the plot.

``` python
# Set seed to 104
np.random.seed(104)

sample_means = []
# Loop 100 times
for i in range(100):
  # Take sample of 20 num_users
  samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
  # Calculate mean of samp_20
  samp_20_mean = np.mean(samp_20)
  # Append samp_20_mean to sample_means
  sample_means.append(samp_20_mean)
  
# Convert to Series and plot histogram
sample_means_series = pd.Series(sample_means)
sample_means_series.hist()
# Show plot
plt.show()

```
