# Tracking lead responses
Your company uses sales software to keep track of new sales leads. It organizes them into a queue so that anyone can follow up on one when they have a bit of free time. Since the number of lead responses is a countable outcome over a period of time, this scenario corresponds to a Poisson distribution. On average, Amir responds to 4 leads each day. In this exercise, you'll calculate probabilities of Amir responding to different numbers of leads.

### Instructions 1/4

* Import poisson from scipy.stats and calculate the probability that Amir responds to 5 leads in a day, given that he responds to an average of 4.

``` python
# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of 5 responses
prob_5 = poisson.pmf(5, 4)

print(prob_5)

```

``` output
output:
    0.1562934518505317

```

### Instructions 2/4

* Amir's coworker responds to an average of 5.5 leads per day. What is the probability that she answers 5 leads in a day?

``` python
# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of 5 responses
prob_coworker = poisson.pmf(5, 5.5)

print(prob_coworker)

```

``` output
output:
    0.17140068409793663

```

### Instructions 3/4

* What's the probability that Amir responds to 2 or fewer leads in a day?

``` python
# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of 2 or fewer responses
prob_2_or_less = poisson.cdf(2, 4)

print(prob_2_or_less)

```

``` output
output:
    0.23810330555354436

```

### Instructions 4/4

* What's the probability that Amir responds to more than 10 leads in a day?

``` python
# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of > 10 responses
prob_over_10 = 1 - poisson.cdf(10, 4)

print(prob_over_10)

```

``` output
output:
    0.0028397661205137315

```
