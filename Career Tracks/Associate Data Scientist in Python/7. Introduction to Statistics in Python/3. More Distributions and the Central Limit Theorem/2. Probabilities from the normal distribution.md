# Probabilities from the normal distribution
Since each deal Amir worked on (both won and lost) was different, each was worth a different amount of money. These values are stored in the amount column of amir_deals and follow a normal distribution with a mean of 5000 dollars and a standard deviation of 2000 dollars. As part of his performance metrics, you want to calculate the probability of Amir closing a deal worth various amounts.

norm from scipy.stats is imported as well as pandas as pd. The DataFrame amir_deals is loaded.

### Instructions 1/4

What's the probability of Amir closing a deal worth less than $7500?

``` python
# Probability of deal < 7500
prob_less_7500 = norm.cdf(7500, 5000, 2000)

print(prob_less_7500)

```

``` output
output:
    0.8943502263331446

```
### Instructions 2/4

What's the probability of Amir closing a deal worth more than $1000?

``` python
# Probability of deal > 1000
prob_over_1000 = 1- norm.cdf(1000, 5000, 2000)

print(prob_over_1000)

```

``` output
output:
    0.9772498680518208

```

### Instructions 3/4

What's the probability of Amir closing a deal worth between $3000 and $7000?

``` python
# Probability of deal between 3000 and 7000
prob_3000_to_7000 = norm.cdf(7000, 5000, 2000) - norm.cdf(3000, 5000, 2000)

print(prob_3000_to_7000)

```

``` output
output:
    0.6826894921370859

```

### Instructions 4/4

What amount will 25% of Amir's sales be less than?

``` python
# Calculate amount that 25% of deals will be less than
pct_25 = norm.ppf(0.25, 5000, 2000)

print(pct_25)

```

``` output
output:
    3651.0204996078364

```
