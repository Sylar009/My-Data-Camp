# Modeling time between leads
To further evaluate Amir's performance, you want to know how much time it takes him to respond to a lead after he opens it. On average, he responds to 1 request every 2.5 hours. In this exercise, you'll calculate probabilities of different amounts of time passing between Amir receiving a lead and sending a response.

### Instructions 1/3

* Import expon from scipy.stats. What's the probability it takes Amir less than an hour to respond to a lead?

``` python
# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes < 1 hour
print(expon.cdf(1, scale=2.5))

```

``` output
output:
    0.3296799539643607

```

### Instructions 1/3

* What's the probability it takes Amir more than 4 hours to respond to a lead?

``` python
# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes > 4 hours
print(1 - expon.cdf(4, scale=2.5))

```

``` output
output:
    0.20189651799465536

```


### Instructions 3/3

* What's the probability it takes Amir 3-4 hours to respond to a lead?

``` python
# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes 3-4 hours
print(expon.cdf(4, scale=2.5) - expon.cdf(3, scale=2.5))
```

``` output
output:
    0.09929769391754684
