# Guess the correlation
On the right, use the scatterplot to estimate what the correlation is between the variables x and y. Once you've guessed it correctly, use the New Plot button to try out a few more scatterplots. When you're ready, answer the question below to continue to the next exercise.

Which of the following statements is NOT true about correlation?

### Instructions


* If the correlation between x and y has a high magnitude, the data points will be clustered closely around a line.
* Correlation can be written as r.
* If x and y are negatively correlated, values of y decrease as values of x increase.
* Correlation cannot be 0.

``` output
Correlation cannot be 0.
