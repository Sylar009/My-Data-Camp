# Simulating sales deals
Assume that Amir usually works on 3 deals per week, and overall, he wins 30% of deals he works on. Each deal has a binary outcome: it's either lost, or won, so you can model his sales deals with a binomial distribution. In this exercise, you'll help Amir simulate a year's worth of his deals so he can better understand his performance.

numpy is imported as np.

### Instructions 1/4

* Import binom from scipy.stats and set the random seed to 10.

``` python
# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

```

### Instructions 2/4

* Simulate 1 deal worked on by Amir, who wins 30% of the deals he works on.

``` python
# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Simulate a single deal
print(binom.rvs(1, 0.30, size=1))

```

``` output
[1]

```
### Instructions 3/4

* Simulate a typical week of Amir's deals, or one week of 3 deals.

``` python
# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Simulate 1 week of 3 deals
print(binom.rvs(3, 0.30, size=1))

```

``` output
[1]

```

### Instructions 4/4

* Simulate a year's worth of Amir's deals, or 52 weeks of 3 deals each, and store in deals.
* Print the mean number of deals he won per week.

``` python
# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Simulate 52 weeks of 3 deals
deals = binom.rvs(3, 0.30, size=52)

# Print mean deals won per week
print(np.mean(deals))

```

``` output
0.8269230769230769
