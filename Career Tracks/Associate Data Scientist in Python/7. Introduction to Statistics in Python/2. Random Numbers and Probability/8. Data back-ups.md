# Data back-ups
The sales software used at your company is set to automatically back itself up, but no one knows exactly what time the back-ups happen. It is known, however, that back-ups happen exactly every 30 minutes. Amir comes back from sales meetings at random times to update the data on the client he just met with. He wants to know how long he'll have to wait for his newly-entered data to get backed up. Use your new knowledge of continuous uniform distributions to model this situation and answer Amir's questions.

### Instructions 1/4

* To model how long Amir will wait for a back-up using a continuous uniform distribution, save his lowest possible wait time as min_time and his longest possible wait time as max_time. Remember that back-ups happen every 30 minutes.


``` python

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30


```

### Instructions 2/4

* Import uniform from scipy.stats and calculate the probability that Amir has to wait less than 5 minutes, and store in a variable called prob_less_than_5.


``` python

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform 

# Calculate probability of waiting less than 5 mins
prob_less_than_5 = uniform.cdf(5, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_less_than_5)


```

``` output

 output:
    0.16666666666666666

```    
### Instructions 3/4

* Calculate the probability that Amir has to wait more than 5 minutes, and store in a variable called prob_greater_than_5.


``` python

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting more than 5 mins
prob_greater_than_5 = 1 - uniform.cdf(5, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_greater_than_5)


```

``` output
0.8333333333333334

```
### Instructions 4/4

* Calculate the probability that Amir has to wait between 10 and 20 minutes, and store in a variable called prob_between_10_and_20.


``` python

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting 10-20 mins
prob_between_10_and_20 = uniform.cdf(20, min_time, max_time) - uniform.cdf(10, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_between_10_and_20)


```

``` output

0.3333333333333333
